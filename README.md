##### Applied Machine Learning Foundations
In this course, the first installment in the two-part Applied Machine Learning series, instructor Derek Jedamski digs into the foundations of machine learning, from exploratory data analysis to evaluating a model to ensure it generalizes to unseen examples. Instead of zeroing in on any specific machine learning algorithm, Derek focuses on giving you the tools to efficiently solve nearly any kind of machine learning problem.<br>
